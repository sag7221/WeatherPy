### Retrieve Weather Data and Weather Description
In this challenge we need to analyze weather data of over 2000 latitide and longitude coordinates.
So we retrieved the nearest city, and perform an API call with OpenWeatherMap, to get weather data along with weather description.

### Create a travel destinations Map
Based on the weather data created, create a list of possible destinations based on customer's weather criteria of min temp and max temp and display those locations as pop-up markers. Using Google Places API provide hotel names for these possible destinations.

### Create Travel Itinerary Map
Using Google Directions API create a travel itinerary map of 4 cities. Also add markers to these 4 cities.
